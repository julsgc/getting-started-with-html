<b>THE WEB</b>
  <blockquote>
  The web is the network of collected documents saved on servers and an individuals computers - all connected to one another, consisting of:<br>
  <br>
  URLS
    <blockquote>
		    The Uniform Resource Locator is the file location or address of a file on the web (it is the www.blahblahblah.ninja for example).
	  </blockquote>
  HTTP
    <blockquote>
		The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a standard that allows users to exchange information found on webpages. It directs your computer over the internet to the servers where the document needed for your web page is stored. There is also FTP and HTTPS.
	  </blockquote>
  WEB APPLICATIONS
    <blockquote>
		Any software/application that runs in a web browser, created in various languages (Java, CSS and HTML, for example)
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<br>
<b>A WEBPAGE</b>
  <blockquote>
	is a text document written in a web application language interpreted by your web browser to display them
  </blockquote>
<br>
<b>HTML VOCABULARY</b>
	<blockquote> 
   HTML is a web application language used to make web pages and consists of: 
    <blockquote>
		TAGS -<br> 
    An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets.
		    <blockquote> 
        CLOSING - ones that require both a < > and < / > for example <br>
        VOID - these do not require a closing slash tag 
		    </blockquote>
    ELEMENTS - <br>
    Everything within a set of opening and closing tags. 
        <blockquote>
			  INLINE - keep information in the same line<br>
        BLOCK  -separating paragraphs, creating blocks of information 
		    </blockquote>
    ATTRIBUTE<br>
    The property of an HTML element. They sit inside the tag within quotations marks.<br>
    For example the link to www.studiograce.net looks like <!-- these commands will not show on the page until i figure out that command ;-) --> 
    <a href="www.studiograce.net">studio grace rocks</a>
    </blockquote>

<br>
<b>CODING WORKS LIKE THIS</b><br>
  <blockquote>
  Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example the computer might do this by making text like this:
  <!-- these commands will not show on the page until i figure out that command ;-) --> 
  I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
  </blockquote>
<br>
<b>COMPUTERS ARE STUPID</b>
  <blockquote>
  Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").<br>
	For example, if you forget to close a <!-- these commands will not show on the page until i figure out that command ;-) -->  
  <b> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. </b> <br>
  This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.
  </blockquote>
<br>
<b>PROGRAMMERS CANâ€™T REMEMBER EVERYTHING</b> <br>
<i>(aka my favorite thing about this world so far!)</i> <br>
  <blockquote>
	There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.
